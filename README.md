# Hello-World
My first repository

Hello!

I enjoy running when I feel like it and being a couch potatoe when I don't. I have a dog named Weezer who sleeps all day. She's literally my spirit animal, since I've got to work I'm just living out the dream through her. I'm also a student and will probably always consider myself one. Learning is fun for me, but I usually get carried away with the next new thing after I get started. Hoping to see this through and learn to explore the world of web developing :)
